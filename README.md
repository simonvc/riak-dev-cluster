Riak Dev Cluster for OS X
=========================

Easily run a 5-node [Riak](http://wiki.basho.com/Riak.html) cluster on
OS X.

* The names of the nodes are riak[1-5]@127.0.0.1
* The HTTP port of riak1 is 11098: <http://127.0.0.1:11098>
* Riak Control (Admin UI) is available
    [here](https://admin:admin@127.0.0.1:11098/admin)
* All nodes use the
    [LevelDB](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/leveldb/)
    storage backend [Riak
* Search](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/search/) is
    disabled (default)
* Please see the `/etc/riak.conf` in each node's directory for the other
    ports and settings

## Getting started

Ensure that [Open File
Limits](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/tuning/open-files-limit/#Mac-OS-X)
are set

Clone and navigate to the repository:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/basho/riak-dev-cluster.git
$ cd riak-dev-cluster
```

There is a `bootstrap` command available that installs, starts, and
joins the Riak cluster in one go:

```
rake bootstrap
```

## Control commands

Start all nodes:

```
rake start
```

Join all nodes as a cluster (only needed once):

```
rake join
```

Stop all nodes:

```
rake stop
```

Clear all data and restart the cluster:

```
rake clear
```

Restart all nodes without clearing all data:

```
rake restart
```

## Riak Data Types

There are a few `rake` commands that will set up your cluster to use
[Riak Data
Types](http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/dev/using/data-types/). You can
create a [bucket
type](http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.2/dev/advanced/bucket-types/) for
using [Riak
counters](http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.2/dev/using/data-types/#Counters)
called `counters`:

```
rake counter_bucket
```

You can do the same for sets:

```
rake set_bucket
```

And for maps:

```
rake map_bucket
```

## Other commands

See all available commands by running `rake -T` or just `rake` by
itself.

## Note

Depending on your Erlang cookie, you may have to use the commands with
`sudo`.
